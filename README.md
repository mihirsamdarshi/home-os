# Raspberry Pi Dashboard

A WIP dashboard for the various services running on my Raspberry Pi

### Services

Currently on my Raspberry Pi I have:
  - [PiHole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole)
  - [AiruPnP](https://github.com/philippe44/AirConnect)
  - [rpifancontrol](https://github.com/mihirsamdarshi/rpi-fan-control-rs)
  - [PiVPN](https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn)

I want to be able to access a dashboard and view the statuses of each of these
applications.

I also kind of just want to mess around with SolidJS, SolidStart, and Axum.
