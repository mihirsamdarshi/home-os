# Raspberry Pi Dashboard

A WIP dashboard for the various services running on my Raspberry Pi

### Services

Currently on my Raspberry Pi I have:
  - PiHole
  - AiruPnP
  - [rpifancontrol][https://github.com/mihirsamdarshi/rpi-fan-control-rs]
  - PiVPN

I want to be able to access a dashboard and view the statuses of each of these
applications.

I also kind of just want to mess around with SolidJS, SolidStart, and Axum.
